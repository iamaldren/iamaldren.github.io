Professionally, I am doing backend development since the day I started working, and having Java as my primary language.

I started my career in a Software Engineering firm, headquartered in London, immersed with strong technical background on Banking Solutions platform in Banking and Financial Industries. I took roles on  Development projects, as well as Application Support.

I am currently working in Singapore, assigned in a well-known financial institution doing API and backend developments for Data Analytics use.

Before transferring to Singapore, I worked in Malaysia for almost 4 years, assigned in a financial institution whose main office is in Singapore, and leading a small team of developers (3 people).

I am trying to build knowledge in other languages (Python, Go, Javascript) to broaden my skillsets.

Personally, I do love to travel a lot and see the world. I was also a dancer, but due to lack of time and platform I was not able to pursue this talent of mine. I do like to read during my free time, and anything cosmic tickles my fancy (Who doesn't? Blackholes are one interesting behemoths!). 

Also, I am casual gamer who loves RPG a lot.

Well folks! That's me.
